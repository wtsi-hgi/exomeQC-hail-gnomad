New branch of code under development for birth cohort WES

# sanger_gnomad_hail_qc

This repository contains hail scripts designed to import, analyse and execute sample_qc and variant_qc on a collection of data cohorts at the Sanger Institute.
The scripts are adapted from the gnomad sample and variant QC v2 and v3 analysis. (https://github.com/broadinstitute/gnomad_qc/blob/master/gnomad_qc/v2/ , https://github.com/broadinstitute/gnomad_qc/tree/master/gnomad_qc/v3).

Please visit https://confluence.sanger.ac.uk/display/HGI/WSI+Exome+Joint+Call for more information on the order of running the scripts, code snippets and results.
Please contact Pavlos (pa10) for any questions.
